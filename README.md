🌤️ Weather App - Real-Time Weather Checker 🌤️
I built a clean and user-friendly Weather App that allows users to check the current weather conditions by simply entering a city name.

✨ Features:

Stylish and engaging UI with a dreamy background design

Responsive input form for city name

Fetches live weather data (API integration planned/implemented)

Intuitive layout with a professional look and feel

🛠️ Tech Stack:

HTML & CSS for layout and styling

JavaScript (Planned/Included) for functionality and API integration

Hosted locally using Live Server

This project helped me enhance my frontend skills and understand the importance of UI/UX in web apps.
